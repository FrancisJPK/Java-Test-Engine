# Java-Test-Engine
Test game engine free for you to look around (?

CONTROLS:
WASD- move
CTRL- move faster
SHIFT- move slower

I was bored using an old notebook once. That notebook had netBeans on it, and i wanted to test my skills. This is what came out.
There's certain things in the code that are totally nonsense, but sincerely i dont care, it was fun writing it.
I hope you can use it in something usefull or at least it gives you ideas to inspire you to do something!

Notes: 
#collision detection is a thing to fix in the engine.
i don't remember why i did so many unnecessary checkings but it is doing the job

#maps are generated, adding a map loader would be fun

#i'm going to add "engine stats" in the near future, for example: player pos; amount of loaded objects; etc.
